      "source": "I'll be using a *top-down* teaching method, which is different from how most math courses operate.  Typically, in a *bottom-up* approach, you first learn all the separate components you will be using, and then you gradually build them up into more complex structures.  The problems with this are that students often lose motivation, don't have a sense of the \"big picture\", and don't know what they'll need.\n\nIf you took the fast.ai deep learning course, that is what we used.  You can hear more about my teaching philosophy [in this blog post](http://www.fast.ai/2016/10/08/teaching-philosophy/) or [in this talk](https://vimeo.com/214233053).\n\nHarvard Professor David Perkins has a book, [Making Learning Whole](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Learning-Whole-Principles-Transform/dp/0470633719) in which he uses baseball as an analogy.  We don't require kids to memorize all the rules of baseball and understand all the technical details before we let them play the game.  Rather, they start playing with a just general sense of it, and then gradually learn more rules/details as time goes on.\n\nAll that to say, don't worry if you don't understand everything at first!  You're not supposed to.  We will start using some \"black boxes\" such as random forests that haven't yet been explained in detail, and then we'll dig into the lower level details later.\n\nTo start, focus on what things DO, not what they ARE."

This is different from how most traditional math & technical courses are taught, where you have to learn all the individual elements before you can combine them (Harvard professor David Perkins call this *elementitis*), but it is similar to how topics like *driving* and *baseball* are taught.  That is, you can start driving without [knowing how an internal combustion engine works](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/thoughts-after-taking-the-deeplearning-ai-courses-8568f132153), and children begin playing baseball before they learn all the formal rules."

You're left confused by the enormous range of techniques shown and have little practical understanding of how to apply them.\n\nThe good news is that modern machine learning can be distilled down to a couple of key techniques that are of very wide applicability. Recent studies have shown that the vast majority of datasets can be best modeled with just two methods:\n\n- *Ensembles of decision trees* (i.e. Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines), mainly for structured data (such as you might find in a database table at most companies)\n- *Multi-layered neural networks learnt with SGD* (i.e. shallow and/or deep learning), mainly for unstructured data (such as audio, vision, and natural language)\n\nIn this course we'll be doing a deep dive into random forests, and simple models learnt with SGD. You'll be learning about gradient boosting and deep learning in part 2."

Well, perhaps not...\n\nPossibly **the most important idea** in machine learning is that of having separate training & validation data sets. As motivation, suppose you don't divide up your data, but instead use all of it.  And suppose you have lots of parameters:\n\n<img src=\"images/overfitting2.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 70%\"/>\n<center>\n[Underfitting and Overfitting](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/361/when-is-a-model-underfitted)\n</center>\n\nThe error for the pictured data points is lowest for the model on the far right (the blue curve passes through the red points almost perfectly), yet it's not the best choice.  Why is that?  If you were to gather some new data points, they most likely would not be on that curve in the graph on the right, but would be closer to the curve in the middle graph.\n\nThis illustrates how using all our data can lead to **overfitting**. A validation set helps diagnose this problem."

With the existing information we've shown, we can't tell. However, random forests have a very clever trick called *out-of-bag (OOB) error* which can handle this (and more!)\n\nThe idea is to calculate error on the training set, but only include the trees in the calculation of a row's error where that row was *not* included in training that tree. This allows us to see whether the model is over-fitting, without needing a separate validation set.\n\nThis also has the benefit of allowing us to see whether our model generalizes, even if we only have a small amount of data so want to avoid separating some out to create a validation set.\n\nThis is as simple as adding one more parameter to our model constructor. We print the OOB error last in our `print_score` function below."
